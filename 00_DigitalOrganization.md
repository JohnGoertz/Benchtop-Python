# 00: Digital Organization for Experimental Analysis

This guide aims to help you achieve some level of sanity when it comes to the digital world of your lab life. First, I'll describe what I believe should be the guiding philosophy of your digital organization (and your science, more generally): reproducibility. Everything else in this guide is intended to help you achieve that goal, from the seemingly trivial concept of how to arrange your files to the more complex task of releasing your work into the wild for anyone to play with.

This guide is meant to be followed in order, but not necessarily all at once. I've tried to write sections in order of importance so that even if you only read the first two or three and ignore the rest you'll be better off than where you started. I suggest you approach it in an iterative way, adopting one or two guidelines at a time then moving on to the rest once you're comfortable with the workflow.

Hopefully you find this useful!
